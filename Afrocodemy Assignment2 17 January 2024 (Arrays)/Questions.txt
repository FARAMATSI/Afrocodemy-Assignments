1. Find largest and smallest elements of an array. N.B. hard code the array

2.Write a program to check if elements of an array are same or not it read from front or back.
  : its checking if the array elements read the same either using the front direction or back? 
    if either of the two is true, it means the elements are the same.
  :(e.g) 1,2,3,3,2,1 reads the same from back or front

3.Given an array of 10 integers, copy all the elements in an another array but in reverse order
  

4.Write a program to find the sum and product of all elements of an array.


5.
Take an array of 10 elements. Split it into middle and store the elements in two dfferent arrays. E.g.-
INITIAL array :
58	24	13	15	63	9	8	81	1	78

After spliting :
58	24	13	15	63
9	8	81	1	78

6.Write a Java program to find all pairs of elements in an array whose sum is equal to a specified number
  : (e.g) - e.g if array is 3,4,5,2,6,8,0 and the specified number is 8 result is {{3,5}, {2,6}, {8,0}}

7.Write a Java program to find common elements between two integer arrays.
 :(e.g) - for 2 arrays {1,5,6-9,8,2,4} and {3,6,2,4} result is {6,2,4}
